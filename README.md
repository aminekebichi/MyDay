## About

Managing tasks, deadlines, meetings, and assignments happens across disconnected tools with no single, coherent view of the day. **MyDay** gives every user a unified planning dashboard where they can log tasks, schedule meetings, and track deadlines across three core views:

- **Daily To-Do Checklist** — Surfaces today's most actionable items.
- **Weekly Schedule Overview** — Highlights key events and approaching deadlines at a glance.
- **Calendar View** — Maps out the full shape of the current week.

Every interaction — adding a task, marking something complete, or logging a new event — is reflected **instantly across all views in real time**. The interface is designed to stay out of the user's way: inputs are quick, layouts are scannable, and the dashboard adapts fluidly as the week evolves.
